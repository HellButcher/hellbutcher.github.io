## Hello World!

Hello World! Or Maybe just 'Hi'. I'm Christoph, I am a *Software Developer* from Germany. I love programming and most technical or science stuff (although, this formulation isn't very scientific :-) ). I studied [*computer science* at the RWTH](http://www.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/) in Aachen where I got my master degree. I also live there. I work at a company that if focused on *[Operations Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research)*.
